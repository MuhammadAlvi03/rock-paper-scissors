// rock, paper, scissors 
// rock beats paper, loses to scissors
// scissors beats paper, loses to rock
// paper beats rock, loses to scissors

// start with making a function 'getComputerChoice' that will return rock, paper, or scissors

// then write a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors; 
// the function should take two parameters 'playerSelection' and 'computerSelection' and make them
// return a string that declares the winner (for example "You lose! Paper beats rock.")
// make function's 'playerSelection' parameter case insensitive so typing in 'ROCK' is the same as 'rock'
// return the results of the function call so we can use this value


// could start with RNG to return computer choice
// then store the computer choice, and compare it to player choice
